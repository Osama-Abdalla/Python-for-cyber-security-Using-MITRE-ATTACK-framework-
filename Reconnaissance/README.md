# Python for Reconnaissance


This project focuses on the reconnaissance phase of the cybersecurity kill chain, where information is gathered about potential targets before active exploitation. Using Python, I implemented tools and scripts that help automate the discovery of networks, hosts, and publicly available technical information.

# ðŸ“œ Key Topics Covered
- Introduction to Scapy
Explored the Python-based packet manipulation library Scapy for creating, sending, and analyzing network packets.

- Network Scanning
Developed Python scripts to scan and map networks, identify active hosts, and detect open ports/services.

- Introduction to Open Technical Databases
Investigated publicly available technical information sources and APIs to enrich reconnaissance data, such as Shodan and other OSINT-friendly platforms.
