# 🐍 Python for Cybersecurity –  (Using MITRE ATT&CK framework)
This project is part of my Python for Cybersecurity learning journey, where I explored how Python can be applied to real-world cybersecurity challenges. Python’s versatility and extensive library ecosystem make it a powerful tool for automating tasks across the cyberattack lifecycle — benefiting both offensive security testers and defensive security teams.

# 🔹 Key Focus Areas:
Writing custom Python scripts to streamline and automate security workflows.

Applying concepts to cybersecurity use cases inspired by the MITRE ATT&CK and MITRE Shield frameworks.

Demonstrating practical skills in threat detection, incident response, and security testing automation.

# 🛠 Skills & Tools:
- Python scripting
- Security automation
- MITRE ATT&CK framework
- MITRE Shield framework
