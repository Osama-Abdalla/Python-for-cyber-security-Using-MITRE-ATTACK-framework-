# üêç Python for Cybersecurity ‚Äì  (Using MITRE ATT&CK framework)
This project is part of my Python for Cybersecurity learning journey, where I explored how Python can be applied to real-world cybersecurity challenges. Python‚Äôs versatility and extensive library ecosystem make it a powerful tool for automating tasks across the cyberattack lifecycle ‚Äî benefiting both offensive security testers and defensive security teams.

# üîπ Key Focus Areas:
Writing custom Python scripts to streamline and automate security workflows.

Applying concepts to cybersecurity use cases inspired by the MITRE ATT&CK and MITRE Shield frameworks.

Demonstrating practical skills in threat detection, incident response, and security testing automation.

# üõ† Skills & Tools:
- Python scripting
- Security automation
- MITRE ATT&CK framework
- MITRE Shield framework
